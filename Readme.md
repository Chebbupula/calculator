# 1. How to run the project

### 1. Install Python 3 (if not installed yet)

Go to the official website and download the latest version:

https://www.python.org/downloads/

- **Windows**: Download the installer, run it, and **MAKE SURE** to check the box
  `Add python.exe to PATH` (at the bottom of the installer window) before clicking "Install Now".

- **macOS**:
  - I recommend installing via the official installer from the website above (not just Homebrew).
  - Or via Homebrew: `brew install python@3.12`

- **Linux** (Ubuntu/Debian): Python is usually already present, but if you need to update:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip -y
2. Navigate to the project directory
Follow these steps to open the project folder in your terminal or command prompt:
Open your terminal/console application.
If you are on Windows and the project is on a different drive (e.g., E: drive):
"E:"
Navigate into the main folder (e.g., "python pr"):
"cd python pr"
Navigate into the project subfolder (e.g., "calculator"):
"cd calculator"
3. Run the project file
Once you are inside the correct project directory, run the main Python script:
"python calculator.py"
                     ```
